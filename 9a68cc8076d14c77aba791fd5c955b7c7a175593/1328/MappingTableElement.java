/**
 * This is an element which represents a database table. It exists (separately
 * from TableElement in the database model) to allow the runtime to use a
 * description of the underlying table that differs from the actual database.
 * For example, mapping table contains a key which can be thought of as a
 * "fake primary key" and designates the columns which the runtime will use
 * to identify rows.  It is analagous to the primary key of the underlying
 * database table and is typically the same, however the important point
 * is that it is not a requirement.  The table in the database may have a
 * different primary key or may have no primary key at all.  Similarly, the
 * mapping table contains a list of reference keys which can be thought of as
 * "fake foreign key" objects and designate the column pairs used to join
 * the primary table with a secondary table.  These are analagous to
 * foreign keys and may in fact contain identical pairs as the foreign key,
 * but again, this is not a requirement.  The foreign key may define a
 * different set of pairs or may not exist at all.  Although any set of pairs
 * is legal, the user should be careful to define pairs which represent a
 * logical relationship between the two tables.
 * Any mapping table elements which are designated as primary tables have
 * their key set up automatically.  Any mapping table elements which are
 * designated as secondary tables should not have their keys set up directly;
 * the setup is automatically part of the pair definition which makes up the
 * reference key.
