/**
 * This annotation is put on user-supplied annotations in order to cause
 * the hk2-inhabitant-generator tool to create descriptors with certain
 * properties.
 * <p>
 * The user-supplied annotation must have the following properties:<UL>
 * <LI>Must only apply to methods (or classes also annotated with {@link Decorator})</LI>
 * <LI>Must be available at runtime</LI>
 * <LI>Must only be applied to interfaces marked with {@link Configured}</LI>
 * <LI>May have one or zero String fields marked with {@link GeneratedServiceName}</LI>
 * </UL>
 * Only methods of type java.util.List with a parameterized type (e.g. List<Config>) or
 * which take a single parameter and a void return type may be
 * annotated with the user-supplied annotation.  The parameterized actual type (or the type of
 * the parameter) will end up being used
 * as a field in the descriptor.  A single method may have multiple user-supplied annotations
 * marked with this annotation, in which case a different descriptor will be generated for each
 * user-supplied annotation.
 * <p>
 * When a method on an {@link Configured} interface has a user-supplied annotation
 * that is annotated with this interface the hk2-inhabitant-generator will generate
 * a service descriptor with the following properties:<UL>
 * <LI>The implementation class will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>The available contracts will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>The scope will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>If the user-supplied annotation has a field marked with {@link GeneratedServiceName} it will be the name in the descriptor</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the name of the actual type of the List parameterized return type (or the single parametere type) with key METHOD_ACTUAL</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the name of the method with key METHOD_NAME</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the name of the parent {@link Configured} class with key PARENT_CONFGIURED</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 * If a class is annotated with a user-supplied annotation marked with this annotation then that
 * class *must* also be annotated with the {@link Decorate} annotation.  The {@link Decorate} annotation
 * will provide the values for several of the fields as described below.
 * <p>
 * When a class on an {@link Configured} interface has a user-supplied annotation
 * that is annotated with this interface the hk2-inhabitant-generator will generate
 * a service descriptor with the following properties:<UL>
 * <LI>The implementation class will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>The available contracts will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>The scope will be as specified in this annotation</LI>
 * <LI>The name will come from the field annotated with {@link GeneratedServiceName} from the user-supplied annotation defined by
 * the {@link Decorate#with()} method</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the {@link Decorate#targetType()} value with key METHOD_ACTUAL</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the {@link Decorate#methodName()} value with key METHOD_NAME</LI>
 * <LI>It will have a metadata entry with the name of the parent {@link Configured} class with key PARENT_CONFGIURED</LI>
 * </UL>
