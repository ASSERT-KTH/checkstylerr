/**
 * Interface that augment the AdminCommand responsibilities by adding the ability
 * to undo a previously successful execution of an administrative command.
 *
 * <p>The ability to rollback is not meant to be used as an exception handling
 * mechanism while in the {@link AdminCommand#execute(AdminCommandContext)} invocation.
 * The ability to rollback is meant for undoing a successful command execution that
 * need to be roll-backed for reasons outside of the knowledge of the command
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>Roll-backing can be very useful in clustering mode where actions can be performed
 * successfully on some instances but fail on others necessitating to rollback the
 * entire set of instances to a state previous to the action execution.
 *
 * <p>The implementations of this interface must retain any pertinent information necessary
 * to undo the command within its instance context. Therefore all UndoableCommand implementations
 * must have a {@link org.glassfish.hk2.api.PerLookup} scope otherwise the system will flag it
 * as an error and will refuse to execute the command.
 *
 * <p>An undo-able command has a slightly more complicated set of phases execution as compared
 * to the AdminCommand.
 *
 * <p>During the first phase, called the prepare phase, the framework will call
 * this command prepare method as well as all supplemented commands prepare methods (if such
 * supplemented commands implement the UndoableCommand interface). If the prepare phase is
 * not successful, the command execution stops here and the command feedback is returned to the
 * initiator.
 *
 * <p>Once the prepare phase has succeeded, the normal {@link AdminCommand#execute(AdminCommandContext)}
 * method is invoked (and any supplemented methods).
 *
 * <p>If the framework is electing that successful commands execution need to be rolled back, it will
 * call the {@link #undo(AdminCommandContext, ParameterMap, List<Server>)} method on the same instance that was used for the
 * {@link #execute(AdminCommandContext)} invocation, as well as any supplemented commands that implement
 * this interface.

     * <p>For instance, the change-admin-password should probably not be attempted if all the
