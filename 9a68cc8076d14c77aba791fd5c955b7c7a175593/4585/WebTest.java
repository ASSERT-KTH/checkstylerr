/*
 * Unit test for 4936855 ("i18n: request encoding being set after calling
 * getParameter").
 *
 * Originally, this test expected an IllegalStateException to be thrown if
 * ServletRequest.setCharacterEncoding() was called after
 *
 * - ServletRequest.getReader() had been called, or
 * - request params had been parsed,
 *
 * as originally mandated by the Servlet 2.5 spec.
 * However, the Servlet 2.5 spec was later relaxed to log warning and ignore
 * specified encoding, because throwing IllegalStateException would have broken
 * too many non-compliant applications.
 *
 * See
 *
 *   https://servlet-spec-eg.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18
 *
 * for details.
