/**
 * Represents a signal that an event was triggered in a process instance, within a given scope, and
 * targeting a particular element identified by its ID.
 *
 * <p>The scope here can refer to a process definition (for start events), or to a specific element
 * instance, e.g. an activity. Note that the scope may be (and usually is) a different element
 * instance than the one identified by the {@link #getTargetElementId()}.
 *
 * <p>The target element ID refer to the element which should receive the payload of the event, e.g.
 * the boundary event, or the start event. For example, if the scope is a sub process, then the
 * target element ID could refer to one of its boundary events.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: this record is optional, and events can be triggered without this record being emitted.
 * It's meant to be used mostly when the scope and/or target element of the event is far removed
 * from the emitter (e.g. error throw end event, escalation), and there is no special purpose entity
 * associated with the emitter (e.g. timer, message).
