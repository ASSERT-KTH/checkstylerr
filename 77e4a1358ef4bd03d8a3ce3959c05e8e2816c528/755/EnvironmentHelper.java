   * indicators targeted at the gateway, will by default also be enabled for the broker. This method
   * is here to prevent this.
   *
   * <p>Note that currently this is a very crude implementation which takes advantage of the fact
   * that no Spring health indicators are currently implemented for the broker. Therefore, we can
   * simply disable all. In the future, this implementation will need to become more sophisticated.
   *
   * <p>This method must be called by the broker before launching Spring system.
