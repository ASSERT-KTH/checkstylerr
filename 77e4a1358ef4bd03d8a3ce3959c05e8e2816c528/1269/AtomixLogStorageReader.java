/**
 * Implements {@link LogStorageReader} over a {@link RaftLogReader}. Each {@link ApplicationEntry}
 * is considered a block (as per the log storage definition).
 *
 * <p>The implementation does look-ahead by one entry. This is necessary because we usually want to
 * seek to the entry which contains the given position, and in order to know that it does we need to
 * read it, and only then return it via the next {@link #next()} call. It is also safe as we read
 * only committed entries, which may be compacted but remain valid.
 *
 * <p>Note that due to the look-ahead, calling {@link #hasNext()} may result in doing some I/O and
 * mutating the state of the reader.
 *
 * <p>The reader currently simply returns the block as is without copying it - this is safe at the
 * moment because the serialization in the underlying {@link io.atomix.raft.storage.log.RaftLog}
 * already copies the data from disk. When switching to zero-copy, however, because of the
 * look-ahead, this reader will have to copy the block. At that point, we may want to look into
 * doing more than a single-step look-ahead (either here or in the {@link
 * io.zeebe.logstreams.log.LogStreamReader}).
