/**
 * A {@link ByteBufProcessor} to find the position of a single character usable as a split pivot.
 * Applying this to a buffer will output the position of the closing of the section, relative to that buffer's
 * readerIndex, or -1 if the end of the section couldn't be found.
 *
 * Note that this processor is typically used to find split positions in a JSON array inside a streaming JSON
 * response (in which case the constructor variant that detects JSON strings should be used).
 *
 * It is invoked on a {@link ByteBuf} by calling {@link ByteBuf#forEachByte(ByteBufProcessor)} methods.
