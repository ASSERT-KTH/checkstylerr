/**
 * A utility class that allows to perform {@link N1qlQuery N1QL} and {@link SearchQuery FTS} queries
 * synchronously and receive a raw version of the service's JSON response.
 *
 * The responses can directly be exposed as {@link JsonObject} or {@link String}, but custom methods allow
 * to work from a byte array (for N1QL) or String (for FTS) and perform a custom deserialization.
 *
 * Note that this class is outside of the Bucket API as it is {@link InterfaceStability.Uncommitted Uncommitted},
 * and is not common to all Couchbase SDKs.
