 * Sometimes listeners are not interested in receiving all event types, forcing them in checking the event type before
 * doing any type of processing.
 *
 * Alternatively, they can use this annotation to restrict the parameter type or value they really are interested in. In
 * this case, they can restrict to a event type name so that their listener is only called when such event type is
 * dispatched.
