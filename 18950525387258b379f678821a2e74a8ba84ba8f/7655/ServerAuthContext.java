/**
 * This ServerAuthContext class manages AuthModules that may be used to validate client requests. A caller typically
 * uses this class in the following manner:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Retrieve an instance of this class via AuthConfig.getServerAuthContext.
 * <li>Receive initial client request and pass it to <i>validateRequest</i>. <br>
 * Configured plug-in modules validate credentials present in request (for example, decrypt and verify a signature). If
 * credentials valid and sufficient, return. Otherwise throw an AuthException.
 * <li>Authentication complete. <br>
 * Perform authorization check on authenticated identity and, if successful, dispatch to requested service application.
 * <li>Service application finished.
 * <li>Invoke <i>secureResponse</i>. <br>
 * Configured modules secure response (sign and encrypt it, for example).
 * <li>Send final response to client.
 * <li>The <i>disposeSubject</i> method may be invoked it necessary to clean up any authentication state in the Subject.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * An instance may reuse module instances it previous created. As a result a single module instance may be used to
 * process different requests from different clients. It is the module implementation's responsibility to properly store
 * and restore any state necessary to associate new requests with previous responses. A module that does not need to do
 * so may remain completely stateless.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class have custom logic to determine what modules to invoke, and in what order. In addition, this
 * custom logic may control whether subsequent modules are invoked based on the success or failure of previously invoked
 * modules.
 *
 * <p>
 * The caller is responsible for passing in a state Map that can be used by underlying modules to save state across a
 * sequence of calls from <code>validateRequest</code> to <code>secureResponse</code> to <code>disposeSubject</code>.
 * The same Map instance must be passed to all methods in the call sequence. Furthermore, each call sequence should be
 * passed its own unique shared state Map instance.
