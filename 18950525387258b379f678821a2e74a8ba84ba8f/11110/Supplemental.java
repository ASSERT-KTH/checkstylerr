/**
 * Annotation to define a supplemental command
 *
 * A supplemental command runs when a main command implementation is ran, it can be used to attach behaviours to
 * existing commands without modifying the original implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * A supplemental command can be very useful to configure extra or external components of an installation. For instance,
 * a load-balancer module can be installed when a load-balancer is added to a glassfish installation. Such module can
 * contain supplemental commands to supplement commands like "create-instance" in order to update the load-balancer
 * specific information.
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation must use the value() attribute of the @Supplemental annotation to express the supplemented command.
 * Its value is the name of the command as defined by the supplemented command @Service annotation.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example : take a command implementation
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="randomCommand")
 * public MyRandomCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * a supplemental command may be defined as follows :
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="mySupCommand")
 * &#64Supplemental("randomCommand")
 * public MySupplementalCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Another implementation that does not use the same parameter names as the supplemented command will need to use
 * a @Bridge annotation
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="otherSupCommand")
 * &#64Supplemental(value="randomCommand" bridge=MyParameterMapper.class)
 * public OtherSupplementedCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * There can be several supplemental commands for a command implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * A supplemental command can be executed in "isolation" (not part of the supplemented command execution) and should not
 * make any assumption that it is called as part of its supplemented command execution. If a command should not be
 * invokable in isolation, it must not define a name() attribute on the @Service annotation :
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service
 * &#64Supplemental("randomCommand")
 * public MySupplementalCommand implements AdminCommand {
 *  // can only be invoked as a supplemental command
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If a supplemental command is annotated with @Rollback, the annotation will be ignored when the supplemental command
 * is executed in isolation.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a supplemental command is annotated with @Rollback, it is still subject to the supplemented command
 * {@link org.glassfish.api.admin.ExecuteOn#ifFailure()} value to decide whether or not roll-backing should happen in
 * case of failure.
 *
 * <p>
 * When associating a supplemental command to a command X, it's always a good idea to associate a roll-backing
 * supplemental command to the rollbacking command of X. For instance, if an "add-lb-config" supplemental command is
 * attached to the "create-instance" command, a "delete-lb-config" supplemental command should be attached to the
 * "delete-instance" command.
