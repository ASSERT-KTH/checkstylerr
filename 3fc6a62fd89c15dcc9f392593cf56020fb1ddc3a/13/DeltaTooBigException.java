/**
 * Subdocument exception thrown when the delta in an arithmetic operation (eg counter)
 * would result in an out-of-range number (over {@link Long#MAX_VALUE} or under {@link Long#MIN_VALUE}).
 *
 * Note that the server also returns the corresponding error code when the delta value itself is too big,
 * but since the SDK enforces deltas to be of type long, this case shouldn't come up.
