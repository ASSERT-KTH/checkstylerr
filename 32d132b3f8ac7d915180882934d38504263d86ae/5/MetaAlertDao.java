/**
 * The MetaAlertDao exposes methods for interacting with meta alerts.  Meta alerts are objects that contain
 * alerts and summary statistics based on the scores of these alerts.  Meta alerts are returned in searches
 * just as alerts are and match based on the field values of child alerts.  If a child alert matches a search
 * the meta alert will be returned while the original child alert will not.  A meta alert also contains a
 * status field that controls it's inclusion in search results and a groups field that can be used to track
 * the groups a meta alert was created from.
 *
 * The structure of a meta alert is as follows:
 * {
 *   "guid": "meta alert guid",
 *   "timestamp": timestamp,
 *   "source:type": "metaalert",
 *   "alerts": [ array of child alerts ],
 *   "status": "active or inactive",
 *   "groups": [ array of group names ],
 *   "average": 10,
 *   "max": 10,
 *   "threat:triage:score": 30,
 *   "count": 3,
 *   "sum": 30,
 *   "min": 10,
 *   "median": 10
 * }
 *
 * A child alert that has been added to a meta alert will store the meta alert GUID in a "metaalerts" field.
 * This field is an array of meta alert GUIDs, meaning a child alert can be contained in multiple meta alerts.
 * Any update to a child alert will trigger an update to the meta alert so that the alert inside a meta alert
 * and the original alert will be kept in sync.
 *
 * Other fields can be added to a meta alert through the patch method on the IndexDao interface.  However, attempts
 * to directly change the "alerts" or "status" field will result in an exception.
