/**
 * All peer classes to function pointers must derive from FunctionPointer.
 * Defining a subclass lets {@link Generator} create a native function type.
 * A C++ function object gets instantiated for each call to {@code allocate()}
 * as well. That function object can be accessed by annotating any method
 * parameter with {@link ByVal} or {@link ByRef}. By default, an actual
 * function pointer gets passed {@link ByPtr}.
 * <p>
 * To use FunctionPointer, subclass and add a native method named {@code call()}
 * or {@code apply()}, along with its return type and parameters, as well as the
 * usual {@code native void allocate()} method to support explicit allocation,
 * which is typically a requirement for callback functions.
