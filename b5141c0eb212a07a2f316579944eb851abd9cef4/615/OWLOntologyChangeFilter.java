/**
 * Provides a convenient method to filter add/remove axiom changes based on the
 * type of axiom that is being added or removed from an ontology.<br>
 * The general pattern of use is to simply create an instance of the
 * {@code OWLOntologyChangeFilter} and override the appropriate visit methods
 * corresponding to the types of axioms that are of interest. Each visit
 * corresponds to a single change and the {@code isAdd} or {@code isRemove}
 * methods can be used to determine if the axiom corresponding to the change is
 * being added or removed from an ontology - the ontology can be obtained via
 * the {@code getOntology} method.<br>
 * Example: Suppose we are interested in changes that alter the domain of an
 * object property. We receive a list of changes, {@code ontChanges}, from an
 * ontology change listener. We can use the {@code OWLOntologyChangeFilter} to
 * filter out the changes that alter the domain of an object property in the
 * following way:<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * OWLOntologyChangeFilter filter = new OWLOntologyChangeFilter() {
 * <br>
 *      // Override the object property domain visit method
 *      public void visit(OWLObjectPropertyDomainAxiom axiom) {
 *          // Determine if the axiom is being added or removed
 *          if(isAdd()) {
 *              // Get hold of the ontology that the change applied to
 *              OWLOntology ont = getOntology();
 *              // Do something here
 *          }
 *      }
 * }
 * // Process the list of changes
 * filter.processChanges(ontChanges);
 * </pre>
