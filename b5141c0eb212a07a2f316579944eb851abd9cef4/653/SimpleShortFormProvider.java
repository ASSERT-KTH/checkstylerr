/**
 * A very simple short form provider which is intended to provide human readable
 * display names for entities. The following strategy is used: 1) If the entity
 * URI has a fragment then that fragment is returned e.g. http://an.other.com#A
 * would have a short form of "A". 2) If the entity URI does not have a fragment
 * then the last segment of the URI path is used e.g. http://an.other.com/A/B
 * would have a short form of "B". 3) If the entity URI does not have a path
 * then the full URI is returned as a string.
