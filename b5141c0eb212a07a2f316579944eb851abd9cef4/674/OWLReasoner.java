/**
 * An OWLReasoner reasons over a set of axioms (the set of reasoner axioms) that
 * is based on the imports closure of a particular ontology - the "root"
 * ontology. This ontology can be obtained using the
 * {@link OWLReasoner#getRootOntology()} method. When the client responsible for
 * creating the reasoner has finished with the reasoner instance it must call
 * the {@link #dispose()} method to free any resources that are used by the
 * reasoner. In general, reasoners should not be instantiated directly, but
 * should be created using the appropriate
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.OWLReasonerFactory}. <br>
 * <h2>Ontology Change Management (Buffering and Non-Buffering Modes)</h2> At
 * creation time, an OWLReasoner will load the axioms in the root ontology
 * imports closure. It will attach itself as a listener to the
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyManager} that manages the root
 * ontology. The reasoner will listen to any
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyChange}s and respond
 * appropriately to them before answering any queries. If the
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode} of the reasoner (the
 * answer to {@link #getBufferingMode()} is
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode#NON_BUFFERING}) the
 * ontology changes are processed by the reasoner immediately so that any
 * queries asked after the changes are answered with respect to the changed
 * ontologies. If the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode} of
 * the reasoner is
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode#BUFFERING} then ontology
 * changes are stored in a buffer and are only taken into consideration when the
 * buffer is flushed with the {@link #flush()} method. When reasoning, axioms in
 * the root ontology imports closure, minus the axioms returned by the
 * {@link #getPendingAxiomAdditions()} method, plus the axioms returned by the
 * {@link #getPendingAxiomRemovals()} are taken into consideration. <br>
 * Note that there is no guarantee that the reasoner implementation will respond
 * to changes in an incremental (and efficient manner) manner. <br>
 * <h2>Reasoner Axioms</h2> The set of axioms that the reasoner takes into
 * consideration when answering queries is known as the <i>set of reasoner
 * axioms</i>. This corresponds the axioms in the imports closure of the root
 * ontology plus the axioms returned by the {@link #getPendingAxiomRemovals()}
 * minus the axioms returned by {@link #getPendingAxiomAdditions()} <br>
 * <h2>Nodes</h2> The reasoner interface contains methods that return
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.NodeSet}s. These are sets of
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node}s. A {@code Node} contains
 * entities. <br>
 * For a {@code Node&lt;OWLClass&gt;} of classes, each class in the node is
 * equivalent to the other classes in the {@code Node} with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology. <br>
 * For a {@code Node&lt;OWLObjectProperty&gt;} of object properties, each object
 * property in the {@code Node} is equivalent to the other object properties in
 * the node with respect to the imports closure of the root ontology. <br>
 * For a {@code Node&lt;OWLDataProperty&gt;} of data properties, each data
 * property in the {@code Node} is equivalent to the other data properties in
 * the node with respect to the imports closure of the root ontology. <br>
 * For a {@code Node&lt;OWLNamedIndividual&gt;} of named individuals, each
 * individual in the node is the same as the other individuals in the node with
 * respect to the imports closure of the root ontology. <br>
 * By abuse of notation, we say that a {@code NodeSet} "contains" an entity if
 * that entity is contained in one of the {@code Nodes} in the {@code NodeSet}.
 * <br>
 * <h2>Hierarchies</h2> A hierachy (class hierachy, object property hierarchy,
 * data property hierarchy) is viewed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
 * containing nodes connected via edges. Each node in the hierarchy represents a
 * set of entities that are equivalent to each other. Each hierarchy has a top
 * node (see org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node#isTopNode()) and a bottom node
 * (see org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node#isBottomNode()). <br>
 * The figure below shows an example class hierarchy. Each box in the hierarchy
 * represents a {@code Node}. In this case the top node contains
 * {@code owl:Thing} and the bottom node contains {@code owl:Nothing} because
 * the nodes in the hierarchy are {@code OWLClass} nodes. In this case, class
 * {@code G} is equivalent to {@code owl:Thing} so it appears as an entity in
 * the top node along with {@code owl:Thing}. Similarly, class {@code K} is
 * unsatisfiable, so it is equivalent to {@code owl:Nothing}, and therefore
 * appears in the bottom node containing {@code owl:Nothing}. In this example,
 * classes {@code A} and {@code B} are equivalent so they appear in one node,
 * also, classes {@code D} and {@code F} are equivalent so they appear in one
 * node. <br>
 * Asking for the subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the a
 * {@code NodeSet} containing the nodes that contain classes that are strict
 * subclasses of the specified class (expression). For example, asking for the
 * subclasses of class {@code C} returns the {@code NodeSet}
 * {@code &#123;E&#125;} and {@code &#123;owl:Nothing, K&#125;}. <br>
 * Asking for the direct subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the
 * {@code NodeSet} that contains the nodes that contains classes that are direct
 * subclasses of the specified class. For example, asking for the direct
 * subclasses of class {@code A} returns the {@code NodeSet} containing the
 * nodes {@code &#123;C&#125;} and {@code &#123;D, F&#125;}. Note that there are
 * convenience methods on {@link NodeSet} and
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node} that can be used to directly
 * access the entities in a {@code NodeSet} without having to iterate over the
 * nodes and entities in a {@code NodeSet}. For example, a "plain" stream of
 * classes contained inside the {@code Nodes} contained inside a {@code NodeSet}
 * can easily be obtained using the {@link NodeSet#entities()} method. In this
 * case we could quickly obtain {@code &#123;C, D, F&#125;} as the direct
 * subclasses of {@code A} simply by using the
 * {@link #getSubClasses(org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLClassExpression, boolean)}
 * (with boolean=true) method on {@code OWLReasoner} and then we could use the
 * {@link NodeSet#entities()} method on the retuned {@code NodeSet} . <br>
 * Asking for equivalent classes of a class (expression) returns a {@code Node}
 * that contains classes that are equivalent to the class (expression) . For
 * example, asking for the equivalent classes of {@code owl:Nothing} (i.e.
 * asking for the unsatisfiable classes) returns the {@code Node}
 * {@code &#123;owl:Nothing, K&#125;}. <br>

 * <h2>Definitions</h2> In what follows, an extension of the
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/">OWL 2 Functional Syntax</a> is
 * given in order to capture notions like a class being a "direct" subclass of
 * another class. <br>
 * <h3>StrictSubClassOf</h3> Given two class expressions {@code CE1} and
 * {@code CE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code CE1} is a strict subclass of
 * {@code CE2}, written {@code StrictSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)} if {@code O} entails
 * {@code SubClassOf(CE1 CE2)} and {@code O} does not entail
 * {@code SubClassOf(CE2 CE1)} <br>
 * <h3>DirectSubClassOf</h3> Given two class expressions {@code CE1} and
 * {@code CE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code CE1} is a <i>direct</i>
 * subclass of {@code CE2}, written {@code DirectSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)}, with
 * respect to {@code O} if {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)}
 * and there is no class name {@code C} in the signature of {@code O} such that
 * {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubClassOf(CE1 C)} and {@code O} entails
 * {@code StrictSubClassOf(C CE2)}. <br>
 * <h3>StrictSubObjectPropertyOf</h3> Given two object property expressions
 * {@code OPE1} and {@code OPE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code OPE1} is a
 * strict subproperty of {@code OPE2}, written
 * {@code StrictSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)} if {@code O} entails
 * {@code SubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)} and {@code O} does not entail
 * {@code SubObjectPropertyOf(OPE2 OPE1)} <br>
 * <h3>DirectSubObjectPropertyOf</h3> Given two object property expressions
 * {@code OPE1} and {@code OPE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code OPE1} is a
 * <i>direct</i> subproperty of {@code OPE2}, written
 * {@code DirectSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)}, with respect to {@code O} if
 * {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)} and there is
 * no object property name {@code P} in the signature of {@code O} such that
 * {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 P)} and {@code O}
 * entails {@code StrictSubObjectPropertyOf(P OPE2)}. <br>
 * <h3>StrictSubDataPropertyOf</h3> Given two dbject property expressions
 * {@code DPE1} and {@code DPE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code DPE1} is a
 * strict subproperty of {@code DPE2}, written
 * {@code StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)} if {@code O} entails
 * {@code SubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)} and {@code O} does not entail
 * {@code SubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)} <br>
 * <h3>DirectSubDataPropertyOf</h3> Given two data property expressions
 * {@code DPE1} and {@code DPE2} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code DPE1} is a
 * <i>direct</i> subproperty of {@code DPE2}, written
 * {@code DirectSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)}, with respect to {@code O} if
 * {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)} and there is no
 * data property name {@code P} in the signature of {@code O} such that
 * {@code O} entails {@code StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 P)} and {@code O}
 * entails {@code StrictSubDataPropertyOf(P DPE2)}. <br>
 * <h3>DirectClassAssertion</h3> Given an individual {@code j} and a class
 * expression {@code CE} and an ontology {@code O}, {@code CE} is a direct class
 * assertion (type) for {@code j}, written {@code DirectClassAssertion(CE j)},
 * if {@code O} entails {@code ClassAssertion(CE j)} and there is no class name
 * {@code C} in the signature of {@code O} such that {@code O} entails
 * {@code ClassAssertion(C j)} and {@code O} entails
 * {@code StrictSubClassOf(C CE)}.
 * <h3>ObjectPropertyComplementOf</h3> Given an object property expression
 * {@code pe}, the object property complement of {@code pe} is written as
 * {@code ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)}. The interpretation of
 * {@code ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)} is equal to the interpretation of
 * {@code owl:topObjectProperty} minus the interpretation of {@code pe}. In
 * other words, {@code ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)} is the set of pairs of
 * individuals that are not in {@code pe}.
 * <h3>DataPropertyComplementOf</h3> Given a data property expression {@code pe}
 * , the data property complement of {@code pe} is written as
 * {@code DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)}. The interpretation of
 * {@code DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)} is equal to the interpretation of
 * {@code owl:topDataProperty} minus the interpretation of {@code pe}. In other
 * words, {@code DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)} is the set of pairs of individual
 * and literals that are not in {@code pe}.
 * <h3 id="spe">Simplified Object Property Expression</h3> A simplified object
 * property expression is either a named property {@code P}, or an object
 * inverse property of the form {@code ObjectInverseOf(P)} where {@code P} is a
 * named property. In other words, there is no nesting of
 * {@code ObjectInverseOf} operators.
 * <h2>Error Handling</h2> An {@code OWLReasoner} may throw the following
 * exceptions to indicate errors. More documentation for each type of exception
 * can be found on the particular exception class.
