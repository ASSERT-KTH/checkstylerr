/**
 * An {@code OWLParser} parses an ontology document and adds the axioms of the
 * parsed ontology to the {@code OWLOntology} object passed to the {@code parse}
 * methods. <br>
 * {@code OWLParser} implementations are supposed to be stateless, and therefore
 * immutable. By default, implementation factories are injected in
 * OWLOntologyManager instances by a Guice injector at creation in OWLManager.
 * This is not mandatory, and a specific manager can have different
 * implementations injected at any time after creation.<br>
 * OWLParsers are typically used by {@link OWLOntologyManager
 * OWLOntologyManagers} to populate empty {@link OWLOntology OWLOntologies}, but
 * can be used to add axioms to an {@code OWLOntology} that already contains
 * axioms.<br>
 * One such case is parsing {@code owl:imports} which point to documents that
 * are not ontologies. In this case, any axioms parsed from the imported
 * document are added to the existing ontology, which already contains axioms
 * parsed from a different document.
