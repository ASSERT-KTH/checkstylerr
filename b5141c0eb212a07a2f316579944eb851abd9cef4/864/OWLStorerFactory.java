 * Factory for ontology storers. Provide a priority to allow for sorting of

 * and moving up by increments of one. This allows the introduction of more
 * storers at any position in the list: e.g., to insert a new storer in the
 * second position, it is sufficient for it to pick a priority value strictly
 * between 0 and 1. Storers can be provided by adding a Guice module to the
 * injector used for binding, or set directly on the manager after, or in place
 * of, injection.
