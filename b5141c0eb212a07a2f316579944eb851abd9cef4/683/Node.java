/**
 * Represents a node (set) of entities. The entities in a node are equivalent to
 * each other. <br>
 * <h3>Nodes in hierarchies</h3> In the OWL API, a reasoner treats a class
 * hierarchy, an object property hierarchy or a data property hierarchy as a
 * hierarchy (directed acyclic graph - DAG) of {@code Nodes}. Each node contains
 * entities that are equivalent to each other. A hierarchy contains a <i>top
 * node</i>, which is the ancestor of all nodes in the hierarchy, and a
 * <i>bottom node</i> In a class hierarchy, the nodes contain {@code OWLClass}
 * objects. The top node contains {@code owl:Thing} (and any other named classes
 * that are equivalent to {@code owl:Thing}). The bottom node contains
 * {@code owl:Nothing} (and any other named classes that are equivalent to
 * {@code owl:Nothing} - these classes are <i>unsatisfiable</i> In an object
 * property hierarchy, the nodes contain {@code OWLObjectProperty} objects. The
 * top node contains {@code owl:topObjectProperty} (and any other named object
 * properties that are equivalent to {@code owl:topObjectProperty}). The bottom
 * node contains {@code owl:bottomObjectProperty} (and any other named object
 * properties that are equivalent to {@code owl:bottomObjectProperty}). <br>
 * In a data property hierarchy, the nodes contain {@code OWLDataProperty}
 * objects. The top node contains {@code owl:topDataProperty} (and any other
 * data properties that are equivalent to {@code owl:topDataProperty}). The
 * bottom node contains {@code owl:bottomDataProperty} (and any other data
 * properties that are equivalent to {@code owl:bottomDataProperty}). <br>
 * <h4>Class Hierarchy Example</h4> The figure below shows an example class
 * hierarchy. Each box in the hierarchy represents a {@code Node}. In this case
 * the top node contains {@code owl:Thing} and the bottom node contains
 * {@code owl:Nothing} because the nodes in the hierarchy are {@code OWLClass}
 * nodes. In this case, class {@code G} is equivalent to {@code owl:Thing} so it
 * appears as an entity in the top node. Similarly, class {@code K} is
 * unsatisfiable, so it is equivalent to {@code owl:Nothing} and therefore
 * appears in the bottom node containing {@code owl:Nothing}. <br>
