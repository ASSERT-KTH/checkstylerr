 * Implementation of the the Optimal String Alignment (sometimes called the
 * restricted edit distance) variant of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
 *
 * The difference between the two algorithms consists in that the Optimal String
 * Alignment algorithm computes the number of edit operations needed to make the
 * strings equal under the condition that no substring is edited more than once,
 * whereas Damerau-Levenshtein presents no such restriction.
