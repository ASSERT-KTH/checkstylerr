     * If a resource is created, used and disposed within the control of the
     * same thread, and never escapes the control of this thread, the use of
     * that resource is thread safe.
     *
     * This could also happen with threads operating on files or other shared
     * resources. Therefore it is important to distinguish between whether an
     * object controlled by a thread is the resource, or if it merely references
     * the resource (like a database connection does). Resources can be any shared
     * resource like an object, array, file, database connection, socket etc. In
     * Java you do not always explicitly dispose objects, so "disposed" means
     * losing or null'ing the reference to the object. Even if the use of an
     * object is thread safe, if that object points to a shared resource like a
     * file or database, your application as a whole may not be thread safe.
     * For instance, if thread 1 and thread 2 each create their own database
     * connections, connection 1 and connection 2, the use of each connection
     * itself is thread safe. But the use of the database the connections point
     * to may not be thread safe.
