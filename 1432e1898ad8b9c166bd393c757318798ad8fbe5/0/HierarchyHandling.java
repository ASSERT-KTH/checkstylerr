/**
 * Options for setting how children of nodes should be handled in the current layout run.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The basic idea is this: If you want nodes to be laid out together across hierarchy levels, set hierarchy handling to
 * {@link #INCLUDE_CHILDREN} on all nodes that should be laid out in one go. As soon as a node's content should be laid
 * out in a separate layout run, set the node's hierarchy handling to {@link #SEPARATE_CHILDREN}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the layout algorithm doesn't support hierarchical layout, this property is ignored and the layout is calculated
 * separately for each child hierarchy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> Layout algorithms only need to differentiate between {@link #INCLUDE_CHILDREN} and
 * {@link #SEPARATE_CHILDREN} as {@link #INHERIT} is evaluated and set to the appropriate more specific value by ELK.
 * </p>
