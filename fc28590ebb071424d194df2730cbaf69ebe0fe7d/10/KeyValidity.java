 * - o :: Unknown (this key is new to the system)
 * - i :: The key is invalid (e.g. due to a missing self-signature)
 * - d :: The key has been disabled (deprecated - use the 'D' in field 12 instead)
 * - r :: The key has been revoked
 * - e :: The key has expired
 * - - :: Unknown validity (i.e. no value assigned)
 * - q :: Undefined validity.  '-' and 'q' may safely be treated as the same value for most
 * purposes
 * - n :: The key is not valid
 * - m :: The key is marginal valid.
 * - f :: The key is fully valid
 * - u :: The key is ultimately valid.  This often means that the secret key is available, but
 * any
 * key may be marked as ultimately valid.
 * - w :: The key has a well known private part.
 * - s :: The key has special validity.  This means that it might be self-signed and expected to
 * be used in the STEED system.
