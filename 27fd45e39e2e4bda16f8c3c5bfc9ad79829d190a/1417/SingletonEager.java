/*
Singleton class which makes sure that only one object of the class gets created and even if 
there are several requests, only the same instantiated object will be returned.

The one problem with this approach is that, the object would get created as soon as the class 
gets loaded into the JVM. If the object is never requested, there would be an object useless 
inside the memory.

Itâ€™s always a good approach that an object should get created when it is required. So, we will 
create an object on the first call and then will return the same object on other successive 
calls.
