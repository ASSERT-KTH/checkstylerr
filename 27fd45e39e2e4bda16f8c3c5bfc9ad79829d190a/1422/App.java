/**
 * In Balking Design Pattern if an objectâ€™s method is invoked when it is in an inappropriate state,
 * then the method will return without doing anything. Objects that use this pattern are generally only in a
 * state that is prone to balking temporarily but for an unknown amount of time
 *
 * In this example implementation WashingMachine is an object that has two states
 * in which it can be: ENABLED and WASHING. If the machine is ENABLED
 * the state is changed into WASHING that any other thread can't invoke this action on this and then do the job.
 * On the other hand if it have been already washing and any other thread execute wash()
 * it can't do that once again and returns doing nothing.
