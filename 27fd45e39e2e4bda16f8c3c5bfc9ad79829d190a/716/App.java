/**
 * 
 * The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all
 * information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information
 * includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.
 * <p>
 * Four terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and client.
 * A command object (spell) knows about the receiver (target) and invokes a method of the receiver.
 * Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command. The receiver then does
 * the work. An invoker object (wizard) knows how to execute a command, and optionally does
 * bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete
 * command, it knows only about command interface. Both an invoker object and several command
 * objects are held by a client object (app). The client decides which commands to execute at which
 * points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.
 * <p>
 * In other words, in this example the wizard casts spells on the goblin. The wizard keeps track of
 * the previous spells cast, so it is easy to undo them. In addition, the wizard keeps track of the
 * spells undone, so they can be redone.
