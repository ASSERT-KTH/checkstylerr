/**

 * Double Checked Locking is a concurrency design pattern used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a
 * lock by first testing the locking criterion (the "lock hint") without actually acquiring the
 * lock. Only if the locking criterion check indicates that locking is required does the actual
 * locking logic proceed.
 * <p>
 * In {@link Inventory} we store the items with a given size. However, we do not store more items
 * than the inventory size. To address concurrent access problems we use double checked locking to
 * add item to inventory. In this method, the thread which gets the lock first adds the item.
