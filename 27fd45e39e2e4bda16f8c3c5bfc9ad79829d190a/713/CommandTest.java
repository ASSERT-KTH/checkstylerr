/**
 * The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all
 * information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information
 * includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.
 * 
 * <p>Four terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and 
 * client. A command object (spell) knows about the receiver (target) and invokes a method of 
 * the receiver.Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command. The receiver
 * then does the work. An invoker object (wizard) knows how to execute a command, and optionally 
 * does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a 
 * concrete command, it knows only about command interface. Both an invoker object and several 
 * command objects are held by a client object (app). The client decides which commands to execute
 * at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.
