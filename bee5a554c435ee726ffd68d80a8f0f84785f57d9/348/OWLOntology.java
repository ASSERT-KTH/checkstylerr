/**
 * Represents an OWL 2
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Ontologies">Ontology</a> in the
 * OWL 2 specification. <br>
 * An {@code OWLOntology} consists of a possibly empty set of
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLAxiom}s and a possibly empty set of
 * {@link OWLAnnotation}s. An ontology can have an ontology IRI which can be
 * used to identify the ontology. If it has an ontology IRI then it may also
 * have an ontology version IRI. Since OWL 2, an ontology need not have an
 * ontology IRI. (See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/">OWL 2
 * Structural Specification</a> An ontology cannot be modified directly. Changes
 * must be applied via its {@code OWLOntologyManager}.
