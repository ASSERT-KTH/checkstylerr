/**
 * Associates an {@link OWLOntologyID} with ontology-less change data.<br>
 * An {@link OWLOntologyChangeRecord} captures information about an
 * {@link OWLOntologyChange} in a way that does not require a reference to an
 * {@link OWLOntology} object. It does this by referencing an
 * {@link OWLOntologyID} instead of referencing an {@link OWLOntology}. The
 * primary reason for doing this is so that changes can be serialized and logged
 * more easily. It should be kept in mind that {@link OWLOntologyChangeRecord}
 * objects can represent changes for which there might be no in memory
 * representation of a specific {@link OWLOntology}. This is also true if an
 * {@link OWLOntology} object has its {@link OWLOntologyID} changed.<br>
 * An {@link OWLOntologyChange} object contains two important pieces of
 * information:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The {@link OWLOntologyID} that identifies the ontology that the change
 * pertains to.</li>
 * <li>The {@link OWLOntologyChangeData} that describes the change specific
 * data. For each kind of {@link OWLOntologyChange} there is a corresponding
 * {@link OWLOntologyChangeData} class which captures the essential details that
 * pertain to the change. The reason for this separation is that it allows
 * change information to be captured where the context of the change (the
 * ontology) is known via some other mechanism.</li>
 * </ol>
 * {@code OWLOntologyChangeRecord} objects are immutable.
