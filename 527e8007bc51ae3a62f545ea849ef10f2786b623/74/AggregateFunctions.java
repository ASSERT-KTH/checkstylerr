 * DSL for N1QL functions in the aggregate category.

 * Aggregate functions take multiple values from documents, perform calculations, and return a single

 *
 * You can only use aggregate functions in SELECT, LETTING, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.
 * When using an aggregate function in a query, the query operates as an aggregate query.
