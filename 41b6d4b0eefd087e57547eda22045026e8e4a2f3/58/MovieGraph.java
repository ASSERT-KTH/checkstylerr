        Label(name) of graph should be non-null and non-empty String.

    Safety for Rep Exposure:
        All fields are modified by key word private, clients can not access the field outside class.
        And there is no other setter function except addVertex, addEdge, removeEdge and removeVertex.
        Anywhere needed get the mutable fields is defencive by defencive copy
