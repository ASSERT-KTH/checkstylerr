/**
 * A {@link io.netty.buffer.ByteBufProcessor} to find the closing position of a JSON string.
 * Applying this to a buffer will output the position of the closing of the string, relative to that buffer's
 * readerIndex, or -1 if the end of the section couldn't be found.
 *
 * It'll take into account the string's opening quote (which is expected to be after the current readerIndex),
 * and ignore escaped quotes inside the string.
 *
 * It is invoked on a {@link io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf} by calling
 * {@link io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf#forEachByte(io.netty.buffer.ByteBufProcessor)} methods.
