/**
 * An enumeration of properties a graph may have. These can be used as part of an {@code EnumSet} to
 * base decisions on graph properties. For example, self-loop processing may be skipped if the graph
 * doesn't contain self-loops in the first place.
 * 
 * <p>An {@code EnumSet} for this enumeration can be attached to a graph via the
 * {@link LayeredOptions#GRAPH_PROPERTIES} property.</p>
 * 
 * <p>{@link org.eclipse.elk.graph.properties.GraphFeature GraphFeature} serves a similar purpose in ELK.
 * However, since this enumeration is more specific to what ELK Layered supports, the two should stay
 * separate.
