    * The algorithm is equivalent to the base conversion of the input <code>

    * As a consequence, the <code>counter</code> shall not be negative and the
    * <code>max_occurence</code> shall be greater or equal to 2.

    *
    * <pre>
    * 0 -> "/x0"
    * 1 -> "/x1"

    * 5 -> "/x5"
    * 6 -> "/x6"
    * 7 -> "/x7"
    * 8 -> "/x8"
    * 9 -> "/x9"
    * 10 -> "/xA"
    * 11 -> "/xB"
    * 12 -> "/xC"
    * 13 -> "/xD"
    * 14 -> "/xE"
    * 15 -> "/xF"
    * 16 -> "/x0/x1"
    * 17 -> "/x1/x1"
    * 18 -> "/x2/x1"
