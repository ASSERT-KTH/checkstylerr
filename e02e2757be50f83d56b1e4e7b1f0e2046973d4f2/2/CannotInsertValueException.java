/**
 * Subdocument exception thrown when the provided value cannot be inserted at the given path.
 *
 * It is actually thrown when the delta in an counter operation is valid, but applying that delta would
 * result in an out-of-range number (over {@link Long#MAX_VALUE} or under {@link Long#MIN_VALUE}).
 *
 * Note that the other case in the protocol where this can happen is when the value is invalid JSON,
 * but since the SDK serializes data to JSON beforehand, this cannot happen (a {@link TranscodingException}
 * would be thrown instead in this case).
